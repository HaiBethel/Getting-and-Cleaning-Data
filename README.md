## The repo includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.md'

- run_analysis.R

- "result" - A folder storing two data sets that the homework requires:

 1. finaldata1.csv
 2. finaldata2.csv

- 'Codebook.md' - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work to clean up the dat.
## What is going on:
R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
